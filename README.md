## 🧠 Why Lumi?

Most productivity apps get bloated fast — too many features, too many popups, too much thinking just to get a task in. **Lumi** was born out of a desire to simplify:

* No login
* No cloud
* No internet dependency
* No distractions

Just you, your thoughts, and a calm space to organize them.

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ **Tasks**: Quickly jot down todos and reminders.
* 💡 **Notes**: Capture thoughts, ideas, or anything you’d write in a personal chat.
* 📅 **Habits**: Visual habit tracker to build routines with ease.
* ✍️ **Reflections**: Daily reflections to help you understand your day and mind better.
* 📊 **App Usage**: See where your time goes with a simple, daily app usage breakdown.

All data is stored **locally on your device**, giving you complete control and privacy.
